  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <img src="headshot.jpg" alt="Isaiah Persad Headshot" width="180" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px; border-radius: 8px;" />

  <p>I‚Äôm Isaiah Persad, a Mechanical Engineering graduate from UBC Okanagan with a deep passion for engineering. I'm currently focused on engineering project coordination with long-term goals in space exploration, innovation-driven entrepreneurship, and building resilient infrastructure that make a difference. My academic path has taken me from the Okanagan to the University of Sydney and the University of Glasgow, shaping a global perspective rooted in curiosity, adaptability, and a drive to solve hard problems.<p>

<p> I‚Äôm passionate about solving complex problems through hands-on work, leadership, and strategic thinking. I enjoy building systems that are practical, scalable, and rooted in strong execution. I have experience with SolidWorks, MATLAB, Python, Bluebeam, Procore, and project documentation systems. I'm most in my element when combining technical thinking with real-world coordination, especially on projects that push boundaries or improve how people live and work.</p>

  <p>At Traine Construction, I worked as a Project Coordinator on an $80M multi-family development, managing procurement, scheduling, contract workflows, and automating internal systems. I also interned at Mawson Rovers in Sydney, where I contributed to rover chassis sensor development and supported the transition of space technology into terrestrial applications across defense and infrastructure sectors. </p>

 <p>Outside of engineering, I‚Äôm usually outdoors - surfing, hiking, skiing, golfing or out on the water. I‚Äôm always looking for new challenges that push me to grow, both as an engineer and as a person. In my free time, I'm building a two-way radio interface that can communicate with an AI language model‚Äîblending analog tech with cutting-edge AI for interactive, voice-driven exchanges. My next adventure takes me to Spain, where I plan to immerse myself in the culture, sharpen my Spanish, and build meaningful connections across languages and communities attending engineering conferences and networking events across Europe.</p>

<p> If you‚Äôre working on something that aligns with aerospace, or innovative infrastructure, I‚Äôd love to connect.<p>

    Capstone Project: Thermal-Controlled Formwork for Winter Concrete Pours
    <img src="traine.jpg" alt="Traine Construction Logo" style="height:40px; vertical-align:middle; margin-left:10px;" />
  </h2>
  <p><strong>UBC Okanagan | Sponsored by Traine Construction & Development</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Project Role:</strong> Project Lead & Mechanical Design Contributor</p>

  <h3>üõ†Ô∏è What We Built</h3>
  <p>A modular, heated formwork blanket designed to maintain curing temperatures for concrete during winter construction. The system integrates with existing Peri gang formwork and uses resistive heating cable and insulative materials to meet CSA A23.1 standards‚Äîreducing cost, energy waste, and cold-weather delays.</p>

  <h3>üéØ Why We Built It</h3>
  <p>Traditional winter concrete curing methods‚Äîtarping, space heaters, or chemical additives‚Äîare costly, inefficient, or affect concrete quality. Our goal was to develop a simple, scalable, and cost-effective thermal solution that contractors would actually use on site.</p>

  <h3>üîÑ How We Got There</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Concept Development:</strong> Defined goals with Traine Construction and scoped design around real site constraints and budget.</li>
    <li><strong>Research:</strong> Assessed industry methods, conducted gap analysis, and explored material and electrical solutions.</li>
    <li><strong>Design Iteration:</strong> Used GRANTA for materials screening, modeled thermal performance, selected heating cable for efficiency and scalability.</li>
    <li><strong>Prototyping:</strong> Fabricated scaled-down prototype, tested insulation performance and temperature retention.</li>
    <li><strong>Final Design:</strong> Delivered a lightweight, modular blanket with polyester skin, polyurethane core, and embedded heating cable.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>üë§ My Role</h3>
  <p>I proposed the project and led its execution from day one‚Äîcoordinating a six-person team, managing the budget and schedule, and acting as the main point of contact with our industry sponsor. I organized site integration, led procurement and logistics, and contributed directly to the mechanical and thermal design. From early concept sketches to prototype testing, I was involved in every major decision and ensured our solution delivered real value to real stakeholders.</p>

  <h3>üß† Technical Highlights</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Thermal modeling for ambient loss + hydration heat</li>
    <li>Required heat output: 88 W/m¬≤</li>
    <li>GRANTA-driven material selection for R-value, durability, and cost</li>
    <li>SolidWorks and FEA used for geometry + attachment design</li>
    <li>Modular blanket units for scalable field deployment</li>
  </ul>

<h4>üõ∞Ô∏è Related Project: Thermal Control Systems in Axiom HAB1</h4>
<p>
  Before our Capstone, I worked on thermal regulation systems for a conceptual crewed habitat module‚ÄîAxiom HAB1‚Äîduring my semester abroad at the University of Sydney. The project explored heat management in orbit using passive insulation and active control strategies for internal crew comfort. It laid the foundation for my later work on applied thermal systems.

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>Through this Capstone experience, I gained a deeper appreciation for the design process‚Äînot just as a technical method, but as a mindset. I learned how iteration, teamwork, and adaptability are essential to solving real-world problems.</p>
    <p>What stood out most was the importance of communication and collaboration. The best engineering solutions come from interdisciplinary perspectives, and the most effective engineers are those who can translate complex ideas into clear action.</p>
    <p>This project helped me understand the ethical responsibility of engineers in shaping society and environments. I bring curiosity, focus under pressure, and a willingness to learn to my future career‚Äîand I‚Äôm continuing to work on clarity in communication, patience in uncertainty, and trust in iterative progress.</p>
