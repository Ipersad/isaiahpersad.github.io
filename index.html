    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Iâ€™m Isaiah, a mechanical engineering graduate with a passion for aerospace, leadership, and working with people to bring bold ideas to life. I'm currently focused on engineering project coordination and long-term goals in space exploration, innovation-driven entrepreneurship, and building resilient systems that make a difference.</p>
    <p>Professionally, Iâ€™ve worked as a Project Coordinator at Traine Construction on the Marakai multi-family development, working on procurement, scheduling, contract management, and process automation. I also interned at Mawson Rovers in Sydney, where I contributed to rover chassis sensor development and helped translate space tech into terrestrial applications.</p>
    <p>When Iâ€™m not engineering or exploring aerospace concepts, youâ€™ll find me outdoors: surfing, hiking, or golfing. Iâ€™m also learning Spanish and expanding my global perspective one city at a time.</p>

  <h2>Capstone Project â€“ Thermal-Controlled Formwork for Winter Concrete Pours</h2>
  <p><strong>Institution:</strong> UBC Okanagan | <strong>Sponsor:</strong> Traine Construction & Development</p>
  <p><strong>Role:</strong> Project Lead & Mechanical Designer</p>

  <p>Proposed and spearheaded a full-cycle engineering project to address winter concrete curing inefficiencies in Canadian construction.</p>
  <p>Coordinated a six-member team through budgeting ($1,000 CAD), scheduling, procurement, risk management, and stakeholder communication, including client and faculty liaisons.</p>
  <p>Designed and tested a modular, energy-efficient heated formwork blanket using resistive heating cables and GRANTA-optimized materials.</p>
  <p>Aided technical development including finite element analysis, SolidWorks design, and performance testing of insulative and protective materials.</p>
  <p>Delivered final design with cost-effective, scalable thermal control (targeting CSA A23.1 curing requirements), ready for integration with Peri gang formwork systems.</p>
  <p>Oversaw prototype fabrication and data-driven thermal modeling ensuring compliance with industry standards and energy benchmarks.</p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>Through this Capstone experience, I gained a deeper appreciation for the design processâ€”not just as a technical method, but as a mindset. I learned how iteration, teamwork, and adaptability are essential to solving real-world problems.</p>
    <p>What stood out most was the importance of communication and collaboration. The best engineering solutions come from interdisciplinary perspectives, and the most effective engineers are those who can translate complex ideas into clear action.</p>
    <p>This project helped me understand the ethical responsibility of engineers in shaping society and environments. I bring curiosity, focus under pressure, and a willingness to learn to my future careerâ€”and Iâ€™m continuing to work on clarity in communication, patience in uncertainty, and trust in iterative progress.</p>
