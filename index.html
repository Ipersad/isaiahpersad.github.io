  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <img src="headshot.jpeg" alt="Isaiah Persad Headshot" width="180" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px; border-radius: 8px;" />

  <p>I‚Äôm Isaiah Persad, a Mechanical Engineering graduate from UBC Okanagan with a deep passion for engineering. I'm currently focused on project coordination and leadership with long-term goals in space exploration, innovation-driven entrepreneurship, and building resilient infrastructure that make a difference. My academic path has taken me from the Okanagan to the University of Sydney and the University of Glasgow, shaping a global perspective rooted in curiosity, adaptability, and a drive to solve hard problems.<p>

<p> I‚Äôm passionate about solving complex problems through hands-on work, leadership, and strategic thinking. I enjoy building systems that are practical, scalable, and rooted in strong execution. I have experience with SolidWorks, MATLAB, Python, Bluebeam, Procore, and project documentation systems. I'm most in my element when combining technical thinking with real-world coordination, especially on projects that push boundaries or improve how people live and work.</p>

  <p>At Traine Construction, I worked as a Project Coordinator on an $80M multi-family development, managing procurement, scheduling, contract workflows, and automating internal systems. I also interned at Mawson Rovers in Sydney, where I contributed to rover chassis sensor development and supported the transition of space technology into terrestrial applications across defense and infrastructure sectors. </p>

 <p>Outside of engineering, I‚Äôm usually outdoors - surfing, hiking, skiing, golfing or out on the water. I‚Äôm always looking for new challenges that push me to grow, both as an engineer and as a person. In my free time, I'm building a two-way radio interface that can communicate with an AI language model‚Äîblending analog tech. My next adventure takes me to Spain, where I plan to immerse myself in the culture, sharpen my Spanish, and build meaningful connections across languages and communities, attending engineering conferences and networking events across Europe.</p>

<p> If you‚Äôre working on something that aligns with aerospace, or innovative infrastructure, I‚Äôd love to connect.<p>

    Capstone Project: Thermal-Controlled Formwork for Winter Concrete Pours

    <p style="margin-top: 10px;"><strong>UBC Okanagan | Sponsored by Traine Construction & Development</strong></p>
  </div>
  <p><strong>Project Role:</strong> Project Lead & Mechanical Design Contributor</p>

  <h3>üõ†Ô∏è What We Built</h3>
  <img src="built.jpeg" alt="Protype" width="180" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px; border-radius: 8px;" />
  <p>A modular, heated formwork blanket designed to maintain curing temperatures for concrete during winter construction. The system integrates with existing Peri gang formwork and uses resistive heating cable and insulative materials to meet CSA A23.1 standards‚Äîreducing cost, energy waste, and cold-weather delays.</p>

  <h3>üéØ Why We Built It</h3>
  <img src="cold.jpeg" alt="Why we built it" width="180" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px; border-radius: 8px;" />
  <p>Traditional winter concrete curing methods‚Äîtarping, space heaters, or chemical additives‚Äîare costly, inefficient, or affect concrete quality. Our goal was to develop a simple, scalable, and cost-effective thermal solution that contractors would actually use on site.</p>

  <h3>üîÑ How We Got There</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Concept Development:</strong> Defined goals with Traine Construction and scoped design around real site constraints and budget.</li>
    <li><strong>Research:</strong> Assessed industry methods, conducted gap analysis, and explored material and electrical solutions.</li>
    <li><strong>Design Iteration:</strong> Used GRANTA for materials screening, modeled thermal performance, selected heating cable for efficiency and scalability.</li>
    <li><strong>Prototyping:</strong> Fabricated scaled-down prototype, tested insulation performance and temperature retention.</li>
    <li><strong>Final Design:</strong> Delivered a lightweight, modular blanket with polyester skin, polyurethane core, and embedded heating cable.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>üë§ My Role</h3>
  <p>I proposed the project and led its execution from day one‚Äîcoordinating a six-person team, managing the budget and schedule, and acting as the main point of contact with our industry sponsor. I organized site integration, led procurement and logistics, and contributed directly to the mechanical and thermal design. From early concept sketches to prototype testing, I was involved in every major decision and ensured our solution delivered real value to real stakeholders.</p>

  <h3>üß† Technical Highlights</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Thermal modeling for ambient loss + hydration heat</li>
    <li>Required heat output: 88 W/m¬≤</li>
    <li>GRANTA-driven material selection for R-value, durability, and cost</li>
    <li>SolidWorks and FEA used for geometry + attachment design</li>
    <li>Modular blanket units for scalable field deployment</li>
  </ul>

<h4>üõ∞Ô∏è Related Project: Thermal Control Systems in Axiom HAB1</h4>
<p>
  Before our Capstone, I worked on thermal regulation systems for a conceptual crewed habitat module‚ÄîAxiom HAB1‚Äîduring my semester abroad at the University of Sydney. The project explored heat management in orbit using passive insulation and active control strategies for internal crew comfort. It laid the foundation for my later work on applied thermal systems.

  <h2>Reflection</h2>

  <p>Working on this capstone project taught me a lot about what the design process actually looks like in practice‚Äînot just on paper. Iteration is not optional; it‚Äôs the norm. From concept to prototype, nearly every decision was revised or challenged, and that adaptability became one of our greatest strengths. I also learned the importance of scheduling and managing client expectations, especially when working with real industry partners. Balancing technical design with stakeholder communication required constant alignment and forward planning. Cross-disciplinary coordination was another key takeaway‚Äîblending electrical, mechanical, and logistical considerations meant stepping outside our individual roles and collaborating fluidly as a team.</p>

  <p>Teamwork was everything. Whether it was testing insulation materials or organizing site visits, every success came from clear, open communication. No one could have done this project alone, and strong team dynamics were essential to solving problems efficiently and creatively.</p>

  <p>This experience gave me a deeper understanding of the role of a professional engineer. It‚Äôs not just about technical skills‚Äîit‚Äôs about responsibility, safety, communication, and serving the public interest. Engineers shape the built environment, and we must do so with integrity, foresight, and humility.</p>

  <p>Over my time in the School of Engineering, I‚Äôve learned that I bring strengths in leadership, coordination, and big-picture problem solving. I‚Äôm energized by working with people, setting clear goals, and moving projects forward. That said, I recognize that my technical depth‚Äîparticularly in simulation and advanced design‚Äîneeds continued growth. I plan to address this through personal projects, hands-on learning, and actively seeking out challenges that push me out of my comfort zone.</p>

  <p>I‚Äôve also realized how critical it is to surround yourself with good teammates. The right team‚Äîwith shared vision and trust‚Äîmakes all the difference in engineering, and I intend to seek out and help build those teams throughout my career.</p>
