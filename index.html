    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Iâ€™m Isaiah, a mechanical engineering graduate with a passion for aerospace, leadership, and working with people to bring bold ideas to life. I'm currently focused on engineering project coordination and long-term goals in space exploration, innovation-driven entrepreneurship, and building resilient systems that make a difference.</p>
    <p>My academic background includes a Capstone project focused on [Insert Capstone Theme], alongside experience in [mention co-op, internships, or leadership roles]. Iâ€™m especially drawn to complex challenges that require collaboration, systems thinking, and technical creativity.</p>
    <p>When Iâ€™m not engineering or exploring aerospace concepts, youâ€™ll find me outdoorsâ€”surfing, sailing, or snapping Polaroids on film. Iâ€™m also learning Spanish and expanding my global perspective one city at a time.</p>

    <h2>Capstone Project Entry</h2>
    <p><strong>What we did:</strong> Designed and developed [brief description].</p>
    <p><strong>Why we did it:</strong> Our objective was to [problem or goal].</p>
    <p><strong>How we did it:</strong> The process included initial research, iterative prototyping, testing, and final implementation. My contributions focused on [highlight your role].</p>
    <p>We approached the challenge from both engineering and non-engineering perspectives, ensuring technical soundness and real-world applicability. Below are some images illustrating the design process:</p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>Through this Capstone experience, I gained a deeper appreciation for the design processâ€”not just as a technical method, but as a mindset. I learned how iteration, teamwork, and adaptability are essential to solving real-world problems.</p>
    <p>What stood out most was the importance of communication and collaboration. The best engineering solutions come from interdisciplinary perspectives, and the most effective engineers are those who can translate complex ideas into clear action.</p>
    <p>This project helped me understand the ethical responsibility of engineers in shaping society and environments. I bring curiosity, focus under pressure, and a willingness to learn to my future careerâ€”and Iâ€™m continuing to work on clarity in communication, patience in uncertainty, and trust in iterative progress.</p>
