  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <img src="headshot.jpg" alt="Isaiah Persad Headshot" width="180" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px; border-radius: 8px;" />
  <p>Iâ€™m Isaiah Persad, a Mechanical Engineering graduate from UBC Okanagan with international academic experience in Sydney and Glasgow. Iâ€™m passionate about solving complex problems through hands-on work, leadership, and strategic thinking.  I'm currently focused on engineering project coordination and long-term goals in space exploration, innovation-driven entrepreneurship, and building resilient systems that make a difference.</p>
  <p>At Traine Construction, I worked as a Project Coordinator on an $80M multi-family development, managing procurement, scheduling, contract workflows, and automating internal systems. I also interned at Mawson Rovers in Sydney, where I contributed to rover chassis sensor development and supported the transition of space technology into terrestrial applications across defense and infrastructure sectors. </p>
  <p>Iâ€™m drawn to work that blends engineering, entrepreneurship, and real-world impact. I enjoy building systems that are practical, scalable, and rooted in strong executionâ€”whether thatâ€™s coordinating construction trades or developing early-stage product ideas.</p>
  <p>Outside of work, Iâ€™m usually hiking, skiing, golfing, or out on the water. Iâ€™m also learning Spanish, and always looking for new challenges that push me to growâ€”both as an engineer and as a person.</p>

  <h2>Capstone Project â€“ Thermal-Controlled Formwork for Winter Concrete Pours</h2>
  <p><strong>Institution:</strong> UBC Okanagan | <strong>Sponsor:</strong> Traine Construction & Development</p>
  <p><strong>Role:</strong> Project Lead & Mechanical Designer</p>

  <p>Proposed and spearheaded a full-cycle engineering project to address winter concrete curing inefficiencies in Canadian construction.</p>
  <p>Coordinated a six-member team through budgeting, scheduling, procurement and stakeholder communication, including client and faculty liaisons.</p>
  <p>Designed and tested a modular, energy-efficient heated formwork blanket using resistive heating cables and GRANTA-optimized materials.</p>
  <p>Aided technical development including finite element analysis, SolidWorks design, and performance testing of insulative and protective materials.</p>
  <p>Delivered final design with cost-effective, scalable thermal control (targeting CSA A23.1 curing requirements), ready for integration with Peri gang formwork systems.</p>
  <p>Oversaw prototype fabrication and data-driven thermal modeling ensuring compliance with industry standards and energy benchmarks.</p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>Through this Capstone experience, I gained a deeper appreciation for the design processâ€”not just as a technical method, but as a mindset. I learned how iteration, teamwork, and adaptability are essential to solving real-world problems.</p>
    <p>What stood out most was the importance of communication and collaboration. The best engineering solutions come from interdisciplinary perspectives, and the most effective engineers are those who can translate complex ideas into clear action.</p>
    <p>This project helped me understand the ethical responsibility of engineers in shaping society and environments. I bring curiosity, focus under pressure, and a willingness to learn to my future careerâ€”and Iâ€™m continuing to work on clarity in communication, patience in uncertainty, and trust in iterative progress.</p>
